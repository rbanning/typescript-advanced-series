    <strong>Your First Day!</strong> <br/>
    Welcome.  We are so please to see you
    and are looking forward to getting to know you better
    over this course of study. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We approach to learning is a bit different than other institutions.
    Our approach is formally known as Problem-Based Learning, but
    many graduates refer to it as "<em>Throw them in the deep-end
    and see what happens.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    Without further ado, let's get started.
    </p>
    <p>
    Today is an easy day.  We just need you to take care of
    some housekeeping items 
    including <strong>ID Badge</strong>, 
    <strong>Mailbox<strong>,
    and
    <strong>Meal Plan<strong>
  </p>
